Stormsword
===========

Simple iOS 2d game

# Movement

The player will move with WASD keys and can move freely in all four directions.

It is possible (using abilities, for example) for the player to 'leap' or be tossed in the air.



# Camera

The camera looks top-down at the player and art will be rendered with a slight lean to give the illusion of depth (think Zelda).

The Camera will pan in all four directions, following the player but creating bounds when the player hits a wall he/she cannot pass.
